## LIF App

This is the back-end repository of the project.

## Description

School project carried out by a team of three, with a development duration limited to 92 hours. LIF is a social network focused on personal achievements, organized into subcategories and categories, with associated forums. Users can earn titles for specific achievements. The forums are categorized into subcategories and offer features such as the ability to vote and respond to messages. Users can add or remove achievements from their profile, which are all grouped together on their profile page. The application was developed with a "mobile first" approach. We created an achievement recommendation system using Playstation achievements of a large number of users, as we lacked user data for our application.
